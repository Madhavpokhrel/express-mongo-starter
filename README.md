# express-mongo-starter
This is the Desktop library that I wrote to keep tracks of my books. I have wrote this library system using:
  Node Js,
  express,
  MongoDb and
  Ejs.

In this application, I am able to add, edit, update and delete books. MongoDb is the database that I have use in this system.
